# Just A Cat

Scaffold application to show a cat image. 

I created this app, to learn in Flutter project, how to:
- use Scaffold Widget in Flutter
- make swipe gesture detector
- update the stateful widget
- import images to the project
- change the app name
- change the app icon
- update the widget with animation
